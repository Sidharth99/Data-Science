<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
Indian Movie Face database (IMFDB) is a large unconstrained face database consisting of 34512 images of 100 Indian actors collected from more than 100 videos. All the images are manually selected and cropped from the video frames resulting in a high degree of variability interms of scale, pose, expression, illumination, age, resolution, occlusion, and makeup. IMFDB is the first face database that provides a detailed annotation of every image in terms of age, pose, gender, expression and type of occlusion that may help other face related applications.

<h3>Data</h3>
The dataset is cleaned and formatted to give you a total of 26742 images with 19906 images in train and 6636 images in test.

The task is to predict the age of a person from his or her facial attributes. For simplicity, the problem has been converted to a multiclass problem with classes as Young, Middle and Old.
