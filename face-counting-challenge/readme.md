<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
People detection and head counting is one of the classical albeit challenging computer vision application. For this problem, given a group selfie/photo, you are required to count the number of heads present in the picture. You are provided with a training set of images with coordinates of bounding box and head count for each image and need to predict the headcount for each image in the test set.

<h3>Evaluation Metric</h3>
The evaluation metric for this competition is RMSE (root mean squared error) over the head counts predicted for test images.
